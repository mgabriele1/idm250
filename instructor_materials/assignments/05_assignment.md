Design your final project with the idea of conversion for use with a database driven Content Management System. All of your static web page images should look exactly like you want your website pages to look like when the theme is complete.

## Github Release
Make sure your the wordpress starter theme has been pushed to github. Once you've done that, you will need to create a release for this. 

### Creating a tag

Here's a [link](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging) on how to create a git tag. Using your terminal/command line, get inside the folder where your project files are kept: cd `/path/to/my/codebase`. You want to 
1. Create a tag `git tag -l "v0.0.1"`
2. Annotate the tag `git tag -a v0.0.1 -m "v0.0.1"`
3. push the tag `git push origin v0.0.1`

### Creating a release
Use this article [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/me) to create a github release. 

Release Info
- Tag Version = “v0.0.1”
- Title = “v0.0.1”
- Description = "Starter Files"
